<strong>This is an immersive project carried out by the @Rocketseat platform, the entire project was done in one week.</strong>

<div margin-button='10em'>
The project <strong>"Next Level Week"</strong> had eSports as its theme and was divided into two tracks: 
<ol>
<li>Explorer</li>
<li>Ignite</li>

</div>

I started by making the <strong>Explorer</strong> trail, where the focus was HTML, CSS and JS. We build a website for personal information 
and use links from the twitch platform.

On the <strong>Ignite</strong> track we built a server in NodeJs, made a website with React, to display the games and how 
many ads were linked in each game on the server.

The web service also allows the creation of advertisements through the "post ad" button.

Continuing the challenges, we built the mobile part using React-Native, where it displays the games in carousel format and their respective ads.

</div>
By clicking on the game the user is directed to a screen where he can view the ads.

By clicking on "Connect" an interface opens for the user to be able to copy the data.
